# Visualization of multivariate, temporal trajectories using t-SNE trajectories

Increasingly available high-dimensional, longitudinal datasets extending over long periods of time, require novel, integrated data visualization techniques.
Dimensionality reduction methods like t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding allows for visualizing high-dimensional data in low-dimensional (i.e., 2d,3d) spaces.
